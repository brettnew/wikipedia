      <h1>From Today's Featured Article</h1>
    </div>
      <p>Paul Collingwood (born 26 May 1976) was until 2011 a regular member of the England Test cricket team. He is a batting all-rounder, and a medium-pace bowler. His 206 during the 2006–07 Ashes series was the first double century by an England batsman in Australia for 78 years. Three consecutive match-winning performances at the end of the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia brought him enthusiastic approval in the British media, helping to secure the trophy for England. In 2010 he led the England team to their first International Cricket Council trophy, the 2010 World Twenty20. He has made the most One Day International (ODI) appearances for England and was, until recently passed by Ian Bell, the leading ODI run scorer. He announced his retirement from Test cricket in January 2011, during the 5th Test of the 2010–11 Ashes series. He finished on a high, becoming a three-time Ashes winner as England won a series in Australia for the first time in 24 years, with three innings victories contributing to a 3–1 win. He is regarded as one of the finest fielders of his time.

          Refunding Certificates were banknotes issued by the United States Treasury in 1879 which originally promised to pay 4% annual interest in perpetuity. Depicting Benjamin Franklin, they were issued only in the $10 denomination. The issuance of these certificates reflects the end of a coin-hoarding period that began during the American Civil War, and represented a return to public confidence in paper money.</p>
